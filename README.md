This Addon will maintain a Macro for you which uses Healthstone, Spiritual Healing Potion or Rejuventating Siphoned Essence, whichever is available but it will prefer Healthstone over Spiritual Healing Potion.

How it works:

It's actually a very basic addon which will update the given macro every time you either login or your Bag is updated. Therefore it will keep up to date if you just pick up Healthstones.

How to use:

Install Addon
Create a empty Macro called "HAMHealthPot"
Move Macro to Button
reload
Profit!
