This Addon will maintain a Macro for you which uses Healthstone and whichever Healing Potion is in your Bag. 
But it will prefer Healthstone over all Healing Potions.

How it works:

It's actually a very basic addon which will update the given macro every time you either login or your Bag is updated. Therefore it will keep up to date if you just pick up Healthstones.

How to use:

1. Install Addon
2. Create a empty Macro called "HAMHealthPot"
3. Move Macro to Button
4. reload
5. Profit!
